(1.0) Requirements
================================================================================
ghc     - http://haskell.org/ghc/
cabal   - http://haskell.org/cabal
git     - http://git-scm.com


(2.0) Getting the source code
================================================================================
$ git clone git://git.mercenariesguild.net/rivertam.git
$ cd rivertam


(3.0) Installation
================================================================================
Configure it for global installation:
$ runhaskell Setup configure
Or for a local installation:
$ runhaskell Setup configure --prefix=$HOME --user

Build:
$ runhaskell Setup build

And Install:
$ runhaskell Setup install


Start the bot in a terminal and follow the instructions:
$ rivertam

Example files for river.conf, flame.conf and love.conf are in the data path which is echo'd to you when the bot is started.
(rivertam will automagically copy river.conf to the config dir though on it's first run.)


(4.0) Modify the source
================================================================================
A really simply mod is to decide what modules should be compiled in.
Let's assume you like the flame and tremulous related commands, but you're not and a clan and don't want the CW module.
First, open src/Commands.hs in some random text-editor of your choice.
Pretty much on the top you see this line:

	import qualified ComCW

Since you don't want the CW module you comment out ComCw so it looks like this:

	-- import qualified ComCW

Also, after some more lines you will see this:

	modules :: CommandList
	modules = ComTrem.list ++ ComFlameLove.list ++ ComCW.list

You have to remove "++ ComCW.list":

	modules :: CommandList
	modules = ComTrem.list ++ ComFlameLove.list

Don't forget to rebuild it. (Instructions at 1.0)
And you're done!
