(1.0) About the bot
================================================================================
River-Tam is an IRC Bot written in Haskell.

Features:
 * Access System (Levels: Master, User, Peon, Mute)
 * Modularized commands - Only compile what you are going to use. It's easily
   controlled when you build rivertam.
 * Tremded Parser (Send a message to IRC from the server and vice versa)
 * Flame/Love - What can be more humiliating than having an irc bot insult you?
 * Tremulous Master Polling - Find tremulous players, list online clan-players,
     get current scores from a server and all within a second.
 * Clanwars Tracker - Saves clangames to a database, Generates a variety of
    statistics. Clangames are easily added with a brief command in irc.
 * Written in Haskell - Makes the bot very stable.


(2.0) Getting the source code
================================================================================
$ git clone git://git.mercenariesguild.net/rivertam.git
$ cd rivertam


(3.0) Tremded Parser
================================================================================
Send message from IRC to In-Game:
 Syntax:
  (Specified IRC Channel)
  trem: <message>
 Example:
  trem: Hello! I love River-Tam!!!
 Output:
  [IRC] Nickname: Hello! I love River-Tam!!!

Send message from In-Game to IRC:
 Syntax:
  (In-Game)
  irc: <message>
 Example:
  irc: Hello! I love River-Tam too, but leave me alone! I'm playing!
 Output:
  <[T] Nickname> Hello! I love River-Tam too, but leave me alone! I'm playing!

NOTE: You must set up a fifo before using trem -> irc!

Decide some arbitrary path for the fifo, here I'm going to use /tmp/fifo.
You need to enter the path to the fifo in river.conf also.

 $ mkfifo /tmp/fifo

When you later start your tremded you need to pipe it's output to the fifo, specifically stderr.
In this example we pipe both stdout and stderr however:

 $ tremded.x86 &> /tmp/fifo
