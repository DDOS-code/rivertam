 1.0  ->  Requirements
 2.0  ->  Installation
 3.0  ->  Modules


(1.0) Requirements
================================================================================
POSIX compatible system.
ghc >= 6.10     - http://haskell.org/ghc/
Cabal		- http://www.haskell.org/cabal/


(2.0) Installation
================================================================================
Configure it for global installation:
 $ runhaskell Setup configure
Or for a local installation:
 $ runhaskell Setup configure --prefix=$HOME --user

Build:
 $ runhaskell Setup build

Install:
 $ runhaskell Setup install


You now have one of two options:
1) Create .rivertam/ in your home directory and copy river.conf and IpToCountry.csv there.
2) Make sure rivertam is started from the directory with the above files in it.
   (NOTE: for this to work .rivertam/ can't exist)

Modify river.conf to your needs and you're ready to go!

Execute:
 $ rivertam
 (You can find the binary file in the PREFIX/bin directory or often in the /usr/local/bin directory.)
