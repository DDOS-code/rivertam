EVEN Honey is better than %s
When i polled [T] Base i saw %s playing there
While mankind evolved from apes, %s never quite made it out of the tree.
I'm just a simple flamebot and even I have a strong dislike for %s!
I bet %s is the kind of sad, lonely individual that queries irc bots.
%s is even a bigger feeder than raf, and that is quite bad.
There are three types of fail, the simple fail, the epic fail and the %s fail.
%s is the definition of noob.
%s, how about a nice warm cup of shut the fuck up?
It's %t and %s is nerding in front of the computer.
Don't be such a negative nancy, %s.
Who needs toilets when you have %s!
%s's favorite map is rotcannon with unlimited BP.
%s is unable to achieve positive score on Wrath Newbie training server.
%s couldn't fight their way out of a wet paper-bag, with a tyrant!
With the excessive whining produced by %s, one might mistake him/her for a [T] Base admin.
%s, you phail harder than gdott9, and he doesn't even have a car at his 20!
